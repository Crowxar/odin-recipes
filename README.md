<!-- About the Project -->
### About The Project
<a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes">Assignment Link</a> - The goal is to create a recipe website to practice the HTML skills I've learned thus far. It will contain links to recipes and have a few pages, as well as be properly commented and ensuring the file structure is correct.


<!-- Skills Demonstrated -->
### Skills Demonstrated
- File structure
- Proper documentation
- Linking to other sites using correct formatting
- Proper Git commit messages early and often

<!-- Self Reflection -->
### Self Reflection
To be filled out upon completion of the project

### Assignment

#### [Iteration 1: initial structure](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes#iteration-1-initial-structure)

1. Within the `odin-recipes` directory, create an `index.html` file.
2. Fill it out with the usual boilerplate HTML and add an `h1` heading “Odin Recipes” to the body.

#### [Iteration 2: recipe page](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes#iteration-2-recipe-page)

1. Create a new directory within the `odin-recipes` directory and name it `recipes`.
2. Create a new HTML file within the `recipes` directory and name it after the recipe it will contain. For example `lasagna.html`. You can use the name of your favorite dish or, if you need some inspiration, you can find a recipe to use at [Allrecipes](https://www.allrecipes.com/). Be sure to include the usual boilerplate HTML. This boilerplate code should be in every `.html` file you create.
3. For now, just include an `h1` heading with the recipe’s name as its content.
4. Back in the `index.html` file, add a link to the recipe page you just created. Example: Under the `<h1>Odin Recipes</h1>` heading, write out the link like so: `<a href="recipes/recipename.html">Recipe Title</a>`. The text of the link should again be the recipe name.

#### [Iteration 3: recipe page content](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes#iteration-3-recipe-page-content)

Your new recipe page should have the following content:

1. An image of the finished dish under the h1 heading that you added earlier. You can find images of the dish on Google or [Allrecipes](https://www.allrecipes.com/).
2. Under the image, it should have an appropriately sized “Description” heading followed by a paragraph or two describing the recipe.
3. Under the description, add an “Ingredients” heading followed by an **unordered list** of the ingredients needed for the recipe.
4. Finally, under the ingredients list, add a “Steps” heading followed by an **ordered list** of the steps needed for making the dish.

#### [Iteration 4: add more recipes](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes#iteration-4-add-more-recipes)

1. Add two more recipes with identical page structures to the recipe page you’ve already created.
2. Don’t forget to link to the new recipes on the index page. Also, consider putting all the links in an unordered list so they aren’t all on one line.

Example:

```html
 <ul>
    <li><a href="recipes/yourrecipe.html">Recipe Title 1</a></li>
    <li><a href="recipes/yourrecipe.html">Recipe Title 2</a></li>
    <li><a href="recipes/yourrecipe.html">Recipe Title 3</a></li>
  </ul>
```

Copy

Your links won’t be flashy, but for now, just focus on building them out.
